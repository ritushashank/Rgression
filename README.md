Linear Regression Single Variable:-
Case 1: Below table represents current home prices in abc township based on square feet area.

Case 2: In an organization salary of an employs depend on several factors. Based on the given data build a model using simple linear regression to predict the salary of an employee based upon the experience (in years) of the employee.

Problem Statement: Given above data build a machine learning model that can predict home prices based on square feet area
